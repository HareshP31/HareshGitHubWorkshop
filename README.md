4) To push the changes you made using git fetch you must use git merge.


Git Stash/Branch Steps:
1) Add some changes to new repo, use git stash, then you can go back to old changes
2) To apply the changes use git stash apply and you can go back to your edit.
3) Get stash list to see the list of changes you have made
4) To make branches you must use git checkout -b to make a new branch.
